# seancorfield.readme

A simple library that turns examples in your `README.md` file into tests and runs them!

## Usage

Add an alias to your `~/.clojure/deps.edn` file:

```clojure
    :readme {seancorfield/readme {:mvn/version "1.0.next"}}
```

Then the most basic usage is:

    clojure -A:readme -m seancorfield.readme

This turns `README.md`'s examples into tests in `src/readme.clj`, loads and runs them, and then deletes that generated file (line numbers in failures should match line numbers in your original `README.md` file).

You can optionally provide a different file path for the readme and for the generated file:

    clojure -A:readme -m seancorfield.readme test/seancorfield/readme_example.md src/generated_test.clj

If your `README.md` file contains code blocks of the form:

    ```clojure
    some expression
    => result
    ```

This will generate tests of the form:

```clojure
(deftest readme-N
  (is (= result (do some expression))))
```

If there is no `=>` then the Clojure code blocks will be added to the generated test namespace as-is with no direct test. This allows setup code to be shown in the `README.md` file, followed by specific tests.

Each `clojure` code block should be a standalone test. If there are multiple expressions in the code block before `=>` they will be wrapped in a `do`. There must be only one expression after `=>`.

## Development

Build a deployable jar of this library:

    $ clojure -A:jar

Install it locally:

    $ clojure -A:install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables:

    $ clojure -A:deploy
